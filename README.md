# OpenKeychain Intents

These Intents can be used without using Android permissions to start OpenKeychain activities for cryptographic operations, such as encrypt/decrypt/sign/verify, or other method, such as key import.

## Add this library to your project

Add this to your build.gradle:

```
repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    compile 'org.sufficientlysecure:openkeychain-intents:3.0'
}
```

## Usage

All Intents require user interaction, e.g. to finally encrypt the user needs to press the "Encrypt" button.
To do automatic encryption/decryption/sign/verify use the [OpenPGP API](https://github.com/open-keychain/openpgp-api).

### Example Code
Please look into [OpenKeychainIntentsActivity](https://github.com/open-keychain/openkeychain-intents/blob/master/example/src/main/java/org/sufficientlysecure/keychain/intents/example/OpenKeychainIntentsActivity.java).

## Intents defined in this library

#### Android Intent actions:

* ``android.intent.action.VIEW`` connected to .gpg and .asc files: Import Key and Decrypt
* ``android.intent.action.SEND`` connected to all mime types (text/plain and every binary data like files and images): Encrypt and Decrypt
* ``android.intent.action.SEND_MULTIPLE`` connected to all mime types except ``text/*`` and ``message/*``

#### Preferred MIME types
* ``application/pgp-message`` for encrypted OpenPGP data
* ``application/pgp-keys`` to import OpenPGP keys

#### OpenKeychain Intent actions:

We are following [Android Guidelines](http://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters.html) by including the full package name as a prefix.

* ``org.sufficientlysecure.keychain.action.ENCRYPT_TEXT``
  * ``org.sufficientlysecure.keychain.action.EXTRA_TEXT``: To encrypt or sign text, use this extra (type: ``String``)
* ``org.sufficientlysecure.keychain.action.ENCRYPT_DATA``
  * Set data ``Uri`` (``intent.setData()``) pointing to a file/image, anything that can be read via an InputStream
  * ``org.sufficientlysecure.keychain.action.EXTRA_ASCII_ARMOR``: Enable ASCII Armor for file encryption (encoding to Radix-64, 33% overhead) by adding the extra with value ``true``
* ``org.sufficientlysecure.keychain.action.DECRYPT_TEXT``
  * ``org.sufficientlysecure.keychain.action.EXTRA_TEXT``: To decrypt or verify text, use this extra (type: ``String``)
* ``org.sufficientlysecure.keychain.action.DECRYPT_DATA``
  * Set data ``Uri`` (``intent.setData()``) pointing to a file
* ``org.sufficientlysecure.keychain.action.IMPORT_KEY``
  * ``org.sufficientlysecure.keychain.action.EXTRA_KEY_BYTES``: key as byte array (type: ``byte[]``)
  * or set data ``Uri`` (``intent.setData()``) pointing to a file
* ``org.sufficientlysecure.keychain.action.IMPORT_KEY_FROM_KEYSERVER``
  * ``org.sufficientlysecure.keychain.action.EXTRA_QUERY``:Extras: ``query`` (type: ``String``)
  * or ``org.sufficientlysecure.keychain.action.EXTRA_FINGERPRINT`` (type: ``String``)
* ``org.sufficientlysecure.keychain.action.IMPORT_KEY_FROM_QR_CODE``
  * without extras, starts Barcode Scanner to get QR Code
  

#### QR Codes
* ``android.intent.action.VIEW`` with URIs following the ``openpgp4fpr`` (OpenPGP version 4 fingerprint) schema. For example: ``openpgp4fpr:73EE2314F65FA92EC2390D3A718C070100012282``. This is used in QR Codes, but could also be embedded into your website. (compatible with Monkeysphere's and Guardian Project's QR Codes)
* Versioning the scheme makes sense, v3 fingerprints (MD5) are unsecure, v4 is current default
* More infos: https://github.com/ModernPGP/QR/commit/bea5b1298d352c0b53cac7e214264042de6ff79a

#### NFC
* NFC (``android.nfc.action.NDEF_DISCOVERED``) on mime type ``application/pgp-keys`` (as specified in http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3156, section 7)
